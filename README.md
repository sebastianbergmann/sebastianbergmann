Hi!

I am [Sebastian Bergmann](https://sebastian-bergmann.de/index.html?ref=github).
If you develop software using the PHP programming language then you may have come across my name.
I am the creator and maintainer of [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/index.html?ref=github) as well as many other libraries and tools that are commonly used.

You cannot buy PHPUnit, but you can pay for PHPUnit.
And the best way to do so benefits you, your team, and me: let me help you through [consulting, coaching, and training](https://thephp.cc/welcome?ref=github).

Of course, you can also [sponsor my work on PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/sponsors.html?ref=github).
